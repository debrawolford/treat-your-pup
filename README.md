<center> <img src="assets/images/treat-your-pup-logo.png"> </center>
<br>
Treat Your Pup was created using the skills learned during the first three modules of the Full Stack Web Development course. The goal of this project was to create a mobile-first fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

This website is designed for people who want to feed their dogs healthy and fresh meals but might not have the time to do so every day. The website is built with a simple and straightforward design to make the buying process as quick as possible for customers. People are able to contact the company with questions through a contact form, and can sign up to get a 10% discount on their first order.

## Features

### Existing Features
- Fully interactive navigation bar and footer: Allows users to easily navigate through website without needing to use the back button in the browser. The navigation bar items all have the "active" class from Bootstrap so users can easily see which page they are currently viewing.
- A contact form: The form builds a sense of trust for potential customers as it gives them the opportunity to get in touch regarding any questions they might have. All fields are set to required so the form will not be submitted unless they are all filled out.
- FAQ page: This page answers some of the common questions asked by customers so that they don't need to get in touch if their question is listed.
- Social icons: The social icons are located at the bottom of the page and encourages users to stay active with Treat Your Pup on Social Media.
- Meals page: The meals page shows all of the current recipes offered and a short description of them. There is also an option to mix and match meals in case a customer isn't sure which meal their dog will prefer.
- 10% sign up button: Although it is not fully functioning yet as the website is currently static, when a user selects this button a form will pop up allowing the user to create an account in order to get 10% off on their first order.
-  Mobile responsiveness: The website has been designed with both mobile and desktop users in mind. Many of the images disappear when viewing the website from a small screen in order to save space. The navigation bar collapses into a mobile-friendly icon known as a "hamburger" icon, and the "Try it Out" button disappears on mobile screens as well.
- All images have an alt tag for screen readers and in case the image doesn't load properly.

### Hopeful future Features

- Order page: At the moment when wanting to order any of the meals by selecting the order button, nothing happens. This will be updated in the future to include an order process.
- More FAQ answers: Currently there are only the most basic questions and answers. But as we learn what customers ask about we will start adding more questions and answers.
- User Accounts: Due to a lack of knowledge in back end development there are no pages regarding user accounts yet. But the goal is to give customers the option to create an account in order to make future orders simpler and quicker.
